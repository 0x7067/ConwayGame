# Project Status

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Low Impact, Low Effort
- **Contributing Guidelines** - No explicit guidelines for contributors
- **Magic Numbers** - Some constants like `maxAutoStepsPerRun = 500` could be better centralized in a configuration file
- **Core Data Scaling** - No pagination or lazy loading for large numbers of saved boards
- **Single Service Container** - While functional, it could benefit from a more sophisticated Dependency Injection (DI) framework for larger applications

### Medium Impact, Low Effort
- **API Documentation** - Missing comprehensive API documentation for public interfaces

### Medium Impact, Medium Effort
- **Integration Testing** - Could benefit from more end-to-end integration tests

### High Impact, Medium Effort
- **Error UX** - Enhanced user experience around error states and recovery
- **CI/CD Configuration** - No visible continuous integration setup *(partially done)*

### High Impact, High Effort
- **Missing Platform Abstraction** - No clear path for extending to other platforms beyond the Apple ecosystem  
  *Note: A REST API POC based on the Game's engine was created for expanding to other platforms*

### Additional Completed Items
- **CI/CD Configuration** - Done for Engine, CLI and API

## ðŸ“‹ To-Do Items

### High Impact, Low Effort
- **Tight Coupling with CoreData** - Although abstracted through the repository pattern, the main app is still tightly coupled to the CoreData implementation

### High Impact, Medium Effort
- **Memory Growth** - State history tracking could consume significant memory for long-running simulations

### Medium Impact, Medium Effort
- **Single-Threaded Computation** - The game engine doesn't utilize multiple cores for large grid calculations

### High Impact, High Effort
- **State Management Complexity** - Multiple state synchronization points between the repository, service, and ViewModels could be simplified
