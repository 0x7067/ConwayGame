## Key Features of Integration Tests

### Pattern Behavior Validation
Tests validate known Conway's Game of Life patterns:
- **Still Life**: Block (4 cells, stable)
- **Oscillators**: Blinker (3 cells, period 2), Toad (6 cells, period 2)
- **Spaceships**: Glider (5 cells, moves diagonally)
- **Complex Patterns**: Gosper Glider Gun (creates gliders infinitely)

### Performance Testing
- **Grid Scaling**: Tests from 5x5 to 100x100 grids
- **Time Thresholds**: Configurable performance expectations
- **Memory Management**: Large dataset handling without leaks
- **Concurrent Load**: Multiple simultaneous operations

### Error Recovery Testing
- **User-Friendly Errors**: Technical errors transformed to actionable messages
- **Recovery Actions**: Retry, reset, navigation options
- **Cross-Layer Propagation**: Error handling from engine to UI

### Real-World Scenarios
- **Multi-Session Usage**: App lifecycle simulation
- **Large Datasets**: 1000+ boards with pagination
- **Complex User Journeys**: New user to advanced pattern exploration
- **Concurrent Users**: Multiple ViewModels and simultaneous operations

cd ConwayAPI
swift test

# Run specific test class
swift test --filter APIIntegrationTests
```

### Swift Package Engine Tests
```bash
# Run engine integration tests
cd ConwayGameEngine
swift test
```

## Test Utilities Usage

The shared utilities make it easy to write additional integration tests:

```swift
@MainActor
final class MyIntegrationTest: BaseIntegrationTestCase {
    
    func testMyScenario() async throws {
        // Create test board with known pattern
        let boardId = try await createTestBoard(pattern: "glider")
        
        // Measure performance
        let result = try await measurePerformance(
            of: "myOperation",
            expectedMaxTime: 1.0
        ) {
            await testEnvironment.gameService.getNextState(boardId: boardId)
        }
        
        // Validate pattern behavior
        guard case .success(let state) = result else {
            XCTFail("Operation failed")
            return
        }
        
        // Use utility assertions
        assertPatternBehavior(state, matches: .spaceship(population: 5))
    }
}
```

## Configuration

Test configurations are centralized in `IntegrationTestConfig`:

```swift
struct IntegrationTestConfig {
    static let defaultTimeout: TimeInterval = 30.0
    static let maxStepTime: TimeInterval = 0.5
    static let maxFinalStateTime: TimeInterval = 10.0
    static let concurrentOperationCount = 20
    static let stressTestBoardCount = 100
}
```

## Performance Benchmarks

Integration tests include performance benchmarking that tracks:
- Board creation time by size
- Step computation time by grid size
- Final state detection time
- Database operation performance
- API response times
- Memory usage patterns

Results are automatically printed and can be used to detect performance regressions.

## Benefits

These integration tests provide:

1. **Confidence**: Full system behavior validation
2. **Regression Detection**: Performance and functionality regression catching
3. **Documentation**: Real usage examples and expected behaviors
4. **Quality Assurance**: Production-like scenario testing
5. **Development Support**: Easy test utilities for new features
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Automated performance threshold validation

The integration tests complement the existing unit tests by validating the complete system behavior, ensuring that all components work correctly together in real-world usage scenarios.
