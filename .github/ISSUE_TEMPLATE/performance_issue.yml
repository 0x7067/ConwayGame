        If you have specific measurements, please include them.
        Use Xcode Instruments, built-in profilers, or timing observations.
      placeholder: |
        Examples:
        - Generation computation takes 2.5 seconds (should be <100ms)
        - Memory usage grows to 500MB (expected ~50MB)
        - UI freezes for 3-4 seconds during auto-play
        - CPU usage at 100% during simulation
        - Frame rate drops to 10fps during animation

      placeholder: |
        Describe what you think reasonable performance should be:
        - Generation computation should complete in <X seconds
        - UI should remain responsive during simulation
        - Memory usage should stay under X MB
        - etc.

      label: Performance Comparison
      description: |
        Have you noticed different performance in other scenarios?
        For example, smaller boards, different patterns, older iOS versions, etc.
      placeholder: |
        Examples:
        - 50x50 board runs smoothly, but 100x100 is very slow
        - Random patterns perform better than structured patterns
        - Performance was better in previous app version
        - Works fine on newer device but slow on older device
